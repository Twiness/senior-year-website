    	<p>This year, I'm honor to join the badminton team, which indeed made my last year in high school more memorable. Behind the picture, it’s more about the effort and time that each of the players dedicated in for the team. Miles of running, numerous lunge walks and footworks, uncountable drills that had prepared each of players to exceed their limit. Each of us kept insist on conditioning and practicing for this sport, despite we were drenched in sweat or in a tired physical state. Looking back, as if the team just started yesterday. Even though we the seniors are leaving the team, we will still continue our journey with our best. “Run until the birdies fall on the floor,” said our coaches. </p></div>

	    <div class="text-on-left"><p>To be honest, it’s not until senior year that noticed the importance of AP courses and started to take multiple APs. I guess three APs were too much for me (maybe it sounds not that much for you haha)and I felt hard to manage my time. But I met people that are much more splendid than me and was inspired by them. They are able to participate in lots of extracurricular activities and keep a high GPA at the same time, always determined and aspirant. I also benefited from the hands-on projects and labs opportunities that AP courses gave me, especially AP physics. I felt being challenged to do project due to my deficit of practical skills, but I guessthis is why I can learn with a more down-to-earth attitude? Finally, I want to thank myself for trying my best this year, it did mean a lot to me, and there’s still a long way to go.</p></div>

    	<p>Among a few of attractions I had been this year, <a class="link" href="http://www.shinzenjapanesegarden.org/" target="_blank">Shizen Japanese Garden</a> and <a class="link" href="http://www.undergroundgardens.com/" target="_blank">Forestiere Underground Garden</a> are two of which worth mentioning. As I stepped in the Japanese Garden while it was more than 100 degree outside, the coolness from the shades of leaves and trees spread over me. The squirrels and peacocks were living in tranquility, without any worries of human’s interruption. However, the less fairly well-known Forestiere Underground Garden, built by an immigrant Baldassare Forestiere in early 1900s, was a cool underground house he created for himself which later became an underground garden open to public. The most impressive lesson he taught us, is that he created something out of nothing, with his creed of perseverance.   </p></div>
