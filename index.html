    	<p>Behind the festive banquet and great achievement, it’s more about the effort and time that each of the players dedicated in for the team. Miles of running, numerous lunge walks and footworks, uncountable drills that had prepared each of players to exceed their limit, even if some are not awarded. Each of the players kept insist on conditioning and practicing for this sport, despite they are drenched in sweat or in a tired physical state. Looking back, as if the team just started yesterday, but today half of the team is graduating. Even though the seniors are leaving this team, we will still continue our journey with our best, like our underclassmen, “run until the birdies fall on the floor,” as our coach said.</p></div>
