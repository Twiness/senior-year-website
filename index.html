    	<p>This year, I'm honor to join the badminton team, which indeed made my last year in high school more memorable. Behind the picture, it’s more about the effort and time that each of the players dedicated in for the team. Miles of running, numerous lunge walks and footworks, uncountable drills that had prepared each of players to exceed their limit. Each of us kept insist on conditioning and practicing for this sport, despite we were drenched in sweat or in a tired physical state. Looking back, as if the team just started yesterday. Even though we the seniors are leaving the team, we will still continue our journey with our best. “Run until the birdies fall on the floor,” said our coaches. </p></div>
